      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a strong passion for crafting innovative web applications. I graduated from UNLV'S THRIVE DX Full-Stack Bootcamp on 05/01/2023.
        I'm comfortable working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Vite, JWT, SQL, and Bcrypt, I bring a diverse skill set to the table, allowing me to build secure software solutions.
        With JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I create user interfaces that engage users and their experience. 
        With React and Vite, I build efficient applications that are scalable and maintainable.
        On the back-end, I work with JWT, SQL, and Bcrypt to develop secure and reliable server-side functionality. 
        I understand the importance of authentication and encryption for sensitive data, the applications I build follow industry best practices for security.
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my experience. I look forward to potential opportunities to work together and contribute to your software engineering projects.</p>
